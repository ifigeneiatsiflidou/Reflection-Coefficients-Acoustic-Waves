# Analysis of Reflection Coefficients for Elastic and Fluid Seabed Models

This project provides a numerical and graphical study of the reflection of plane acoustic waves at the interface between water and seabed materials. It considers both elastic and fluid seabed models using Snell's Law and acoustic impedance relationships.
